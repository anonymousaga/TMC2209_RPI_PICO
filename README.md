# TMC2209_RPI_PICO and Micropython
This is a libary to drive a stepper motor with a TMC2209 stepper driver and a Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)

This is a clone off the great work from Chr157i4n and kjk25!

This code is still experimental, so use it on your own risk.
I have not tested all functions, hope its a start for others.
