# TMC_2209_ESP32 and Micropython
This is a libary to drive a stepper motor with a TMC2209 stepper driver and a LOLIN32 V1.0.0 ESP32 Board

This is a clone off the great work from Chr157i4n, thank you for the time you spend !

This code is still experimental, so use it on your own risk.
i have not tested all functions, hope its a start for others.
